### Hello folks 👋

I'm Davy (he/him), a senior software engineer | hacker | maker.

These days I'm mostly doing #Rustlang 🦀 and #TypeScript 🛠️.

I ❤️ to learn on a daily basis, to face new challenges and to contribute to open-source. Github is a playground for my experiments.

Enough about me! You can find me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@davy) and on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davyduperron/).
